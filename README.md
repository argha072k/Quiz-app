In this project i have developed a simple multiple-choice quiz in python with GUI- multiple choice quiz in Python with Tkinter.

A quiz application is used to take input in a multiple Choice Questionnaire. Users need to select the right option for the question asked.

For every right choice +4 is awarded and for every wrong answer 0 marks are awarded.

The Quiz consists of 5 questions. We can increase or decrease the number of questions according to convenience.
